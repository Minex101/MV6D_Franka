[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:33 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findisaac_ros_nitros_detection3_d_array_type.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "isaac_ros_nitros_detection3_d_array_type",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "isaac_ros_nitros_detection3_d_array_type" with any of the following names:

    isaac_ros_nitros_detection3_d_array_typeConfig.cmake
    isaac_ros_nitros_detection3_d_array_type-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "isaac_ros_nitros_detection3_d_array_type"
  to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "isaac_ros_nitros_detection3_d_array_type_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "isaac_ros_nitros_detection3_d_array_type" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
